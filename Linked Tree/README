This project implements a non-binary tree implemented using a linked structure.
Each node contains an integer value and links to its parent, left most child, right most child, left sibling and right sibling.

The test program (TestTree.java) instantiates a Tree and allows the input of operations to perform on the tree.
The operations can be input by the user within the program or read from an input file. 
The input instructions can be written in the data file "input.txt".

The program will only accept the following instructions, written in the following format:

size
label
replaceLabel 3
addLeftmostChild 4
addRightmostChild 5
isRoot
isLeaf
gotoRoot
gotoParent
gotoLeftmostChild
gotoRightmostChild
gotoLeftSibling
gotoRightSibling
preOrder
postOrder
levelOrder

Each of these instructions has an associated method in Tree.java. 
See the comments in Tree.java for further information about these instructions and the methods that implement them.
